## Array Operations

- Implement all methods in the `ArrayWrapper` class.
- Implementation details / documentation can be found in the `IArrayWrapper` interface.
- For every implemented method:
  - Write unit tests,
  - Analyze and determine the time complexity (in big O notation) for each operation.
